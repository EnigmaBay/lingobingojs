# User Stories

User stories help the project team understand and define the features that could be implemented based on the target audience. Users should benefit from using the software, and developers should understand whether a feature is *done* or not.

User stories follow a format similar to: "As a [user], I want [some feature], so that [this result benefits me]." *[Source: Code Fellows Project Guidelines, accessed 2-Sept-22]*

User stories should correlate closely to application features. Code Fellows recommended a near 1:1 ratio, and if there are more features than user stories, more user stories should be written. *[Source: Code Fellows Project Guidelines, accessed 2-Sept-22]*

## LingoBingoJS User Story Development

The team is utilizing Miro and GoogleDocs to develop User Stories and Features.

As we work through tasks for each minor and major release, we review features and user stories, and will add to each as needed, refining each where and when necessary.
