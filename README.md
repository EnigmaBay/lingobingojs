# Lingo Bingo JS

LingoBingo webapp game ported to react-js.

## Overview

Jon attended a webinar about engaging audiences online *[Cindy Huggett et al]*. One of the tips was to design a "Buzzword Bingo" game that attendees could play during the webinar to help maintain audience attention and engagement.

In 2021 Jon deployed a simple [LingoBingo game using C# and Azure WebApps](https://github.com/nojronatron/LingoBingoGen). This version was used during a remote training call where there was good participation, as well as positive feedback. Next steps were to add new features to make the game a little more interesting, and provide features that users would expect in an online game.

During the summer of 2022, Jon and Ryan decided to collaborate on this project. Our initial goal is to rewrite it in modern javascript with responsive and dynamic webapp frameworks and tools to improve user experience, as well as practice our software developer craft skills, as a team.

### Vision

Use the existing [LingoBingo project](https://github.com/nojronatron/LingoBingoGen) as a guide and rewrite the app as an HTML, CSS, and Javascript webapp that can then be added on to and improved over time. There is potential for this project to expand into a full MERN-stack webapp.

### Non-function Outcomes

Development of this project will be a collaborative effort, with the following goals:

- Gain experience developing a javascript-based webapp from the ground up.
- Practice project collaboration.
- Exericse UI design and implementation skills and techniques.
- Practice javascript and JS framework interaction and implementation.
- Work toward a full-stack implementation.
- Develop an open-source, utilitarian online 'game' others can use and enjoy.

### Functional Outcomes

To start, we expect to:

- Build a simple HTML5, CSS3, javascript/ES6 webapp that at least duplicates the existing LingoBingo project look, feel, and behavior.
- Implement a componentized design, to support adding features on a semi-regular basis with little code churn.
- Provide a dedicated web interface for people to use the app as they need.

Later on, we hope to do a lot more. As we move out of the planning phase and into initial implementation, this section will receive updates.

## Prequisites

## Contributing

At the start of this project we are a party of 2 and there is no expectation to add contributors at this time.

In the future we could update this information and provide means for public contributions, stay tuned.
